# MuseScore-ElementCounter
Small MuseScore 3+ plugin to count the number of elements selected. Even more niche than BulkVelocityChange.

Install by simply downloading the code from here and copying the .qml file into the MuseScore plugins folder (C:\Program Files\MuseScore [version]\plugins if on Windows).
